# Mine
This is my recreation of the gambling game Mine from Stake.com  made using SceneBuilder JavaFX in Eclipse.

About:

1. Players will start with 100k, this application will save data after each run in a separate encrypted file

2. The multiplier is based on how many gems there are related to bombs. This number will increase as you open more gems

3. The admin button is the tool I used to debug that is passcode protected. This button reveals all bombs during ongoing gameplay and gives 1 million to the user

4. Buttons and sliders will be hidden during a session but will be visible again after you cashout or hit a bomb

5. Profit will show you how much you are still down or up including your bet

6. you have a maximum of your total cash as a bet but going negative  will result in the application being unplayable

7. exit during a game will not save any progress, but hitting a bomb or cashing out will automatically end the game and save your wallet
